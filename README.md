# Striver-s-Worksheet

Doing the problems from the strivers worksheet, which helps me understand data structures and algorithms better. I have been doing the programs using C++.

In computer science, a data structure is a way to store and organize data.

Finding and utilising the right data structure is a crucial step in the computer programming process since it can increase the algorithm's overall efficiency. The difficulty of programme design, as well as the end product's quality and performance, are directly impacted in large-scale systems by selecting the best data structure.
New solutions are published every day.
